# Little-Projects
Just little projects in various languages that I do to keep myself comfortable :)
Great for refreshing a language you haven't seen in a while or just doing some quick coding if you're bored

WARNING!
Some of this is old stuff! Please don't judge! If you see something you think looks cool but you open the file and it's gross code, maybe try writing it yourself as cleanly as you can for a fun little challenge :)
