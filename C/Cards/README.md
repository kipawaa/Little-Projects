# CARDS
This is a small library providing functionality for a basic deck of cards. Hopefully, later on I will add playable games etc to make this more interesting :)

# Current layout
- deck.c
 - provides the Deck structure with the ability to create a new (sorted) deck

# TODO
- add shuffling to deck.c (Riffle, overhand, strip)
- create some basic games (go-fish, solitair etc.)
